title: Welcome to the Australian Crisis Mobility Portal
---

This daily-updated portal aggregates mobility and case data from various sources to give a general picture of how Australians are responding to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. It is a free and public resource meant for journalists, citizens, academics, and colleagues from across the COVID-19 volunteer analysis community. Feedback, queries, and requests may be directed to Rohan Byrne at <rohan.byrne@unimelb.edu.au>

NOTE: This portal was recently reconstructed. Links will be readded in the coming days and should be stable for the remainder of the COVID-19 crisis.
